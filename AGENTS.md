## Writing code

- **Minimal try/except**: let errors propagate — silent failures hide bugs. Only catch exceptions for intentional fault tolerance (retries, robustness).
- **Targeted comments**: don't explain your work process or reference old code. Use targeted comments sparingly to clarify ambiguous logic.
- **Zen of Python**: remember the Zen of Python when writing code.
```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## Running code
- **Modules and environment**: before running the code, you need to activate the environment. 
```
module load cuda/12.6 cudnn gcc arrow/18.1.0 httpproxy
source /home/v/vinjain/scratch/.virtualenvs/skyrl/bin/activate
```
- **Adding dependencies**: add to `pyproject.toml` and run `uv sync --all-extras` to install and lock them.

## Documentation

The documentation is stored in `docs/` and is written in `md` format. Use these files to help you understand the codebase and the project.

## Skills

Skills live in `skills/` and are symlinked to `.claude/skills/`. They teach agents how to handle specific workflows (e.g. starting the inference server, writing configs). When you make changes to the codebase, check if any skills need to be updated to stay accurate.

You are responsible for maintaining the skills folder. When a workflow fails and you fix it – whether with help from the user or through trial and error – you must update the skills to make implicit knowledge explicit. You are also responsible for keeping the skills up to date whenever you or anyone else modifies the code.

## Testing

Write tests as plain functions with pytest fixtures. Don't use class-based tests.

## Git

- **Remotes**: there are two remotes, `origin` and `upstream`. `origin` is the remote you push to, and I will tell you when to pull and merge from `upstream`. Do not push to `upstream` directly.
